This is an internship Project which focuses on augmenting data by training a diffusion model.

How to use:

First, clone the code.

Next, make a 'datasets' directory in the same directory you cloned the code

Then, you have to download 'LSWMD.pkl' in the 'datasets' directory in order to proceed.

You can then start off by preprocessing data via Dat_PreproPforDiff.py.
